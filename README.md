# Performance Evaluation of RANS Turbulence Models for Flow Over Curved Bodies
This project aims to investigate and compare the performance of different Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) turbulence models in simulating flow over curved geometries. The study focuses on evaluating the accuracy, computational efficiency, and predictive capabilities of various RANS models.
