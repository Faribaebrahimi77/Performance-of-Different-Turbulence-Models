# Performance Evaluation of RANS Turbulence Models for Flow Over Curved Bodies


This project performs a comprehensive Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis of steady, incompressible turbulent flow over a curved hump geometry, based on the experimental setup used by Greenblatt et al. The study evaluates the performance of different RANS turbulence models in predicting complex flow phenomena including separation, reattachment, and adverse pressure gradient effects.
