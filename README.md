# Performance-of-Different-Turbulence-Models
This project evaluates turbulence models in CFD, including k-ε, k-ω, RSM, and LES. Their accuracy, cost, and ability to predict separation, reattachment, and wall turbulence are compared. Results validated with experiments provide guidelines for choosing models based on flow features and resources.
